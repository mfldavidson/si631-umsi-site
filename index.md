## UMSI Website Consultation, April 2018

### Who We Are
Anndo Ko, Beijia Wang, Colin Tyrrell, Maggie Davidson, and Marcy Held conducted research as a group (Group 2) for the UMSI website redesign. The research was conducted as a part of the Winter 2018 (Jan-Apr) class SI 631 section 2 (evening section). Our challenge was to provide value to the ongoing UMSI website redesign. We worked on the section of the website whose audience is prospective students for the MSI program. We particularly focused on information about the application process.

### What We Did
We conducted 3 different research projects to provide value to the UMSI website redesign project.

First, we conducted a _Comparative Analysis_ of competitor websites focused on prospective student and application information.

Next, we conducted _Interviews_ with prospective students and admissions staff to understand their needs and mental model for the website.

Last, we researched _2018 Web Trends_ as they relate to the prospective student and application information on the UMSI website.

#### [Comparative Analysis](https://mfldavidson.github.io/si631-umsi-site/comparative-analysis.html)
In our comparative analysis, we review the websites of academic programs that were identified as competitors by UMSI's Marketing & Communications team. We evaluated each of the competitor websites based on 4 specific criteria that focus on ease of discovery of application steps and requirements and an evaluation of how information is presented about the application process. We describe both positive and negative findings, accompanied by visual examples and external background research. Information architecture and interface design recommendations based on these findings and research are also provided.

#### [Interviews](https://mfldavidson.github.io/si631-umsi-site/interview-findings.html)
We conducted semi-structured interviews and completed a participatory co-design exercise with 7 prospective MSI students. We also conducted an interview with the UMSI Assistant Director of Recruitment and Admissions to understand the staff needs. A summary of our interview findings, as well as recommendations for terminology for the "prospective students" portion of the site on the UMSI homepage, are provided.
