Interviews with prospective students
========================

Group Two focused on the application pages for the MSI program. Our group conducted 7 user interviews to learn about prospective students' needs and what they would look for to navigate to information they are seeking.

## Methods
We interviewed 7 individuals with ages ranging from 23 to 26. Five interviewees were male, while 2 were female. Of the 7 interviewees, 4 were from Michigan, 1 was from New Jersey, 1 was from China, and 1 was from Taiwan. Three interviewees were admitted to the MSI program for Fall 2018; two interviewees were current MSI students; one interviewee was a prospective applicant; one interviewee was not a prospective MSI student and was included to get the perspective of someone with no knowledge of industry terms. Of the 6 interviewees with applicable interests, 2 were interested in human-computer interaction, 1 in UX research, 1 in UX design, 1 in statistics and data analysis, and 1 in data governance.

For each interviewee, we asked them a few questions.

First, we asked, "What words would you look for on the homepage if you are trying to find out how to apply for the MSI program at UMSI?"

Next, we showed them a wireframe ([figure 1](https://gitlab.si.umich.edu/borromean/t22/raw/master/wireframe.jpg)) including the names of navigation items currently used in the UMSI mock-up, with "Recruit" missing. We also showed the interviewees cards cut to fit into the one blank navigation space on the wireframe. Each card had a potential name on it, chosen by looking at common names at other schools during the comparative analysis, as well as the current name on the UMSI site mock-ups. The names were as follows:

* Programs
* Academics
* Degrees
* Admissions
* Apply
* Join
* Study
* Recruit

We asked the interviewees to pick which name made the most sense to them by placing it into the empty space on the wireframe. We asked them to explain their choice, and then rank their preference for the remaining choices.

We then asked them follow-up questions about what is most important to them to find on a website first when they are considering a program, as well as what is most important to them when choosing a program in general.

## Positive Findings: Consider these ideas for the UMSI site

### Preferred terminology of “Admissions” 
The word that interviewees most frequently preferred was “Admissions,” with “Join” as a close second. Interviewees noted that “Admissions” is a common term among other school websites they have visited and that it is a direct descriptor of the content contained in that section of the website (information on how to apply, timeline, and the application itself). Participants noted that there seemed to be a bias toward “action words” (verbs) in the homepage heading categories, and although using a word like “Admissions” may break with that convention, clarity should be prioritized over style.

### Preferred verb terminology of “Join” and “Apply” 
The verb that was most popular among interviewees was “Join,” with “Apply” as a close second. “Join” was selected because interviewees noted that it indicated the process of becoming a student (“joining UMSI”). Although “Apply” was mentioned by a few interviewees, they also noted that it may be “too strong” of a word, because students could learn about the application process (and not just apply!) on this section of the website. One interviewee in particular noted that it would not be good for prospective students to be hesitant to click on the “Apply” section, for fear that they may inadvertently start the application process.

## Negative Findings: Avoid these issues for the UMSI site

### Confusion due to the inconsistent point of view of menu items 
It was mentioned in one interview that the perspective of the 5 verbs on the mockups of the homepage (“Recruit,” “Hire,” “Impress,” “Partner,” and “Connect”) is not consistent. Sometimes the verb refers to something that UMSI wants to do (e.g., UMSI wants to “recruit” new students or “impress” site visitors), sometimes the verb refers to something that outside organizations want to do (e.g., Employers want to “partner” with UMSI career development office), and sometimes the verb refers to something that visitors to the site want to do (e.g. “Connect” with UMSI on social media).

Instead, ensure that the perspective of the verbs is consistent.

### “Recruit” homepage heading unpopular
The current word choice of recruit was interpreted as being linked to finding employment, not as a place to find out information about applying to a program at UMSI. The term “Recruit” placed last or almost last in a complete ranking exercise of suggested terms for every participant.

Instead, choose a different word than "Recruit," such as the options discovered to be popular as described above.


Interview with Assistant Director of Recruiting and Admissions
==================================================================

We also conducted an interview with the Assistant Director of Recruiting and Admissions, Rachael Wiener, to understand her perspective on perspective students' needs and how the school should be selling itself. This interview took the form of a conversation, so no methods will be described.

## Positive Findings: Consider these ideas for the UMSI site

### Balance between information goals
Success in Rachael’s mind is when the optimal balance of information is achieved. The balance lies somewhere between too little information but high readability and high navigation ability, and too much information with lower readability and ability to easily navigate. In a nutshell, the information is comprehensive, yet easy to find.

### Effective organization of information
Organization is the easiest way to achieve the optimal balance of information. This occurs at many levels of the site, making this a complex task and topic. More thoughtful organization of sub-levels, such as correct use of lists, bold text, bullets, etc, and generally being extremely concise with writing, should be the primary goal. Most of the site organization discussions will naturally occur around macro organization (navigation menus, pages) versus micro organization (sections, sub-pages, layout of information), but micro organization is important, too.

### Prioritize selling the program
From the perspective of Admissions, two major demographics of prospective students exist: still deciding whether to apply and already decided to apply. Of note, both groups share one common goal (in admission eyes): continued "wooing." This means that selling the school/program should remain the focus throughout sections. Examples of this are career outcomes, learning outcomes, school/program uniqueness, or areas of opportunity (clubs, research). We want the student to understand what they will come away with after 2 years in this program. Within this, priority should go to career outcomes.

### Website can be used as a conversation starter
Any missing information is acceptable as long as the individual is given an easy way to find the majority of the missing information. At the point where the information is left out, a call to action to talk to an admissions advisor begins, which is helpful to the advisor to start the conversation with the prospective student.

### Prospective students' information priorities
Rachael's perspective on a prospective student's priorities on the site are as follows:

1. Admission requirements
2. What makes UMSI unique
3. Career outcomes
4. Ways to get involved (clubs, research)
5. Areas of study/skills gained
7. Financial help/requirements

## Negative Findings: Avoid these issues for the UMSI site

### Information “wormholes”
Information should not be buried and linking to sub information once the user is already on the subpage of the given topic.

Instead, focus on leading the user to the information in only one to three clicks.

### Repetitive information
Information should be displayed on as few pages as possible, preferably one. This allows ease of updating by staff and less chance of information contradictions on the site overall.
