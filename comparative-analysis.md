Summary of Comparative Analysis Findings
========================

Group Two focused on the application pages for the MSI program. Our group performed a comparative analysis of the suggested competitor websites, focusing on a prospective student viewing the website to either find information about applying or to actually apply.

## Methods

The schools' sites that we reviewed were those identified as competitors by UMSI Marketing & Communications. The schools are as follows:

* Carnegie Mellon University
* Cornell University
* Indiana University, Bloomington
* Syracuse University
* University of California, Berkeley
* University of California, Irvine
* University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana
* University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill
* University of Texas, Austin
* University of Washington, Seattle

We omitted Georgia Institute of Technology because we felt that the 10 schools identified above would be representative enough for our purposes.

Each member of our team reviewed two schools on the following elements:

1. What are the steps to navigate to the page that contains information about how to apply and the application process? What do the labels the user clicks on look like?
2. Description of the structure and information contained on pages with information on how to apply and the application process
3. Analysis of the positive elements of the structure and information contained on these pages from a UX perspective
4. Analysis of the negative elements of the structure and information contained on these pages from a UX perspective

After completing the analysis, we had an interpretation session where we collected our findings and identified common elements across the sites that were positive and negative. These findings are laid out below.

## Positive Findings: Consider these ideas for the UMSI site

#### Use of Headings to Chunk Blocks of Text

It's hard to navigate big blocks of text. UX practice tells us that "chunking" the content into smaller, more manageable bits makes it easier to consume. One method of chunking we saw that worked well to break up the big blocks of text was using subheadings throughout the page that told the user what they may find in that section, and minimized text within the section. The Syracuse site ([figure 1](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/figure%201%20syracuse%20checklist.PNG?raw=true)) checklist is an example of an effective layout. The use of large bulleted checklist item titles with smaller detail text is effective for two purposes: quick overview and find the information needed.

Another very effective method of chunking is an itemized list that expands if clicked to show the detailed information (accordion method). University of Washington ([figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/master/figure%202%20washington%20accordion.PNG)) is a good example of this, although, we recommend making the list items larger text than the expanding info to make the differentiation clearer (similar to figure 1).

#### Important information prioritized at top

Be aware of what is most important to your users, and prioritize that information at the top of the page. The MHCI+D program at the University of Washington knew that students looking at the admissions page will primarily want to know when the deadline is before they dive deep into reading the requirements, so they put information about the application deadline at the top ([figure 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/master/figure%203%20washington%20priority.PNG)).

For more information about prioritizing content, see [Nielsen Norman Group.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prioritize-good-content-bubbles-to-the-top/)

#### Comparison table between different programs

The University of Washington has a table ([figure 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/master/figure%204%20washington%20tables.PNG)) that allows a user to quickly compare aspects of different programs offered by the university, even outside of the department that made the table, to identify which is right for them. Creating a table like this to help users understand the difference between MSI, MHI, Engineering MS Design Science, Stamps MDes, and other related degrees would be helpful for students who are having trouble grasping the differences and which program is best for them.

For more information about comparison tables, see [Nielsen Norman Group.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/comparison-tables/)

#### Prioritize a few options (actions) by what users most want to see.

Providing too many options to your user is overwhelming. The sites with good user experience identified the options most important to their users and highlighted them, allowing them to dig deeper using sub-navigation for other, less important content. Syracuse knew that the most important options for prospective students were to view the checklist/requirements, understand funding options, and start the application, so they chose these 3 options of many to highlight to their users ([figure 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/master/figure%205%20syracuse%20options.PNG)), helping the user to make decisions and complete their task.

## Negative Findings: Avoid these issues for the UMSI site

#### Unintuitive steps to get to apply page

Making it hard for your users to find the information on how to apply is a sure way to lose prospective students. The University of North Carolina is a good example of what not to do ([figure 6](http://borromean.pages.umsi.io/t22/figure-6.html)). After students click on "Information for Future Students" from the iSchool homepage, there is no information on the page about applying or any links anywhere on the page that lead to admissions or application information. The user is forced to click on a program in the left-hand navigation, and then look back at the left-hand navigation, where an "Admissions" button has appeared (it wasn't there before!), and click on that, to get to information about applying. The user thinks they know what is in the left-hand navigation after the first step, so is not likely to look back there and see the new link that was not there before.

Instead, focus on only one or two steps for your users to get from the UMSI homepage to admissions information. Put yourself in their shoes (or, better yet, test it with them!) to see what words they look for that indicate where to click to get to the admissions information.

#### Being directed to pages that don't share a standard look and feel

Sites like University of California, Irvine ([figure 7](http://borromean.pages.umsi.io/t22/figure-7.html)) take users to sites that have a vastly different look and feel. This is confusing to users, especially when the link appears to be an internal link.

Instead, focus on only directing the user within the same site, and ensure that all page templates match and do not contain wildly different branding, colors, or navigation. If it is necessary to link a user to a different site (for example, to the Office of Financial Aid), here are a few things that can help the user understand that they are leaving the site they are on:

* Use an [external link icon](https://www.google.com/search?q=external+link+icon&rlz=1C1GGRV_enUS750US752&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw1LC_irPaAhXl44MKHQg7CVYQsAQIJg&biw=1920&bih=989) to tell the user that they are leaving your site.
* Have the link be a button instead of an in-text link. A button signifies to the user that a "major" (to an extent) change is about to happen, such as creating an account, posting a blog, etc. This same significance can be useful in this case to make the user realize that they are going to be leaving the site, a major change. [This UX Movement blog post](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/when-to-use-a-button-or-link/) is a useful resource for understanding when to use buttons or in-text links.
* Explicitly telling the user they are leaving the UMSI site (ex: "Note: this link is to a site outside of the School of Information")

#### Too much text

Users do not read big blocks of online text word for word, so content must be written with this in mind. Large blocks of text like in a book will cause your readers to skip the entire section and get none of the information you wanted to convey. University of California, Irvine falls into this trap by having long webpages with paragraph after paragraph of content ([figure 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/master/figure%208%20irvine%20block%20text.PNG)).

Instead, follow these tips to avoid big blocks of text:

* Chunk your content
* Highlight key words with bold text
* Think about what's really important and try to have as few words as possible

For more information about how to write content for the way users read on the web, see [Nielsen Norman Group.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/)

#### Names of pages and headers do not accurately describe whatâ€™s on that page

Users expect to click a link and end up on a page that is named similarly or the same as the link they clicked. They also expect the header to accurately describe the content on the page. Indiana University's site shows examples of this, such as when the user clicks "How to Apply" and lands on a page with the heading, "Informatics" ([figure 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/master/figure%209%20indiana%20header.PNG)). They may think they have clicked the wrong link because they expected a page about how to apply. Furthermore, when the user reads the content, they realize it is about how to apply to the informatics program, but the header "Informatics" does not accurately describe this.

Instead, make links and the page titles they lead to have similar or the same name. Ensure that page titles accurately describe the content on the page.

#### Call to action links difficult to find

On some sites, call to action links like the button that led to the application process were difficult to find because it was buried in text or another page. For example, users have to read an entire paragraph to find where they can start their application at University of Washington ([figure 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/master/figure%2010%20washington%20buried%20cta.PNG)).

Instead, follow these tips to ensure users can find call to action links, particularly the apply button:

* Understand what your user might be looking for, and make sure you have buttons to answer it. For example, ensure that you have large, clear information replacing your "Apply" button telling the user the application has closed instead of simply taking away the button, because users will still look for the button and be confused when they don't find it.
* Use a large call to action buttons instead of in-text hyperlinks. The user will expect a button instead of a hyperlink because it signifies a major change. Buttons are easier to find than in-text hyperlinks.
* Think carefully about where to put buttons, and make sure they are a logical next step for the user after reading the page. For example, make sure the apply button is on the page where the user reads about the requirements, since the logical next step for them would be to start the application.

#### Scrolling or moving content

Some sites, [including the University of North Carolina,](https://sils.unc.edu/future-students) have content on their pages that move in distracting ways. This type of animated content makes it hard for a user to focus, decreasing the likelihood that they will complete their task and potentially annoying them. This type of content is also difficult for a wide variety of users.

Instead, don't make content move or scroll without the user initiating it.
