# Modern UX Trends Research
Group Two focused on the application pages for the MSI program. To supplement our comparative analysis and interview findings, we examined relevant website trends and best practices related to the design of the UMSI site.

Three sections summarizing recommendations are below. __2018 UX Trends__ provides some examples of the latest techniques for a modern feel. __Psychology for UX__ provides some commonly used tricks (usually in ecommerce websites) that are applicable to the UMSI site. __Calls to Action__ provides some CTA examples that are pertinent for the site's needs.

## 2018 UX Trends
First, we examined modern trends with website design. We selected the best recommendations considering relevance and applicability.

### 1. Broken Grid Layouts
Broken grid layouts are not a new concept for print layouts (the topic is taught in-depth in SI 520 Graphic Design), but they are becoming more popular in web layouts.  This make sense, as it acts as a counter to the 90s style of stiff grid layouts. [Figures 1 and 2](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R1.png?raw=true) show examples of outdated stiff grid layouts, while [figure 3](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R3.png?raw=true) shows an example of a broken grid layout.

This style can be achieved with only a few tweaks to layout, such as major headings overlaid on images and slight overlaps of rectangle div's. Even small changes that break the traditional grid layout can add a very modern feel. The easiest way and suggestion for the UMSI site is to utilize this method in replicated locations (headers and footers) and at the first point of user interaction (the image and heading text at the top of every page), which can then be followed by a traditional (and easier to develop) grid layout for all of the main content.

### 2. Oblique and Organic Shapes
For years, web and app geometry was predominantly right angled. This makes sense given grid layouts and the technical aspects occurring in the background of websites. In 2017, major sites altered their designs to be more rounded. Recent changes by Twitter and Google, as seen in [figure 4](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R4.png) show that even a small change of rounded instead of right corners achieves this feel.

### 3. Subtle Animation
Animation that is slight in nature (often small movements, only occurring once, and controlled by the users inherently occurring actions (scrolling, pressing button) gives a very modern feel. Paramount is that these animations are not distracting, even sometimes barely noticeable.

Two of the ways that subtle animation can be achieved are when objects enter the view or load (see [Brain Traffic](http://www.braintraffic.com), for example) or with unexpected scroll rates or varying scroll rates for different objects  (see [Made By Many](https://www.madebymany.com), for example).

### 4. Floating / Fixed Navigation Menus
Fixed navigation (navigation that remains in place even as you scroll) has been popular recently, but the newest trend is to pop or float the navigation menu on top of the content.  As one site states, "This reinforces the feeling that the navigation is a global object, not necessarily a part of any one page, but there to follow you reassuringly through the site." ([figure 5](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R5.png))  Additionally, due to similar effects to No. 3 above, it has a modern feel.

[Figure 6](https://gitlab.si.umich.edu/borromean/t22/raw/master/Figure%20R6.png) highlights a fixed navigation bar that is simple so as to not obscure viewing the content. However, with a single click, it slides open a very complex navigation menu from the left ([figure 7](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R7.png)), which provides many navigation options--more than could ever be listed statically on the top horizontal nav bar itself.

## Psychology for UX
Next, we researched several online resources examining psychological considerations for website design. We selected the best recommendations considering relevance and  applicability.

### 1. Limiting Choices 
In sales this is sometimes referred to as a "Choice of Three." Limiting options can sometimes have positive effects. "We like to think that if we’re given a wide range of choices, we’ll make better decisions. However research has found time and again that if we’re offered too many choices, what we actually end up with is a state of ‘choice paralysis’ - an inability to choose." (Nahai, MyCustomer, 2014)

While there is a downside to limiting choices, and bias could affect the choosing process (ensure you test with users), forcing site stakeholders to focus on the most important 3 or 4 actions on their sub-pages or to bucket their actions/info is a healthy exercise by itself, even if the final site options are greater in number.

### 2. Leverage Scarcity 
Nahai (MyCustomer, 2014) states that the "principle of scarcity: that which is rare, is also perceived as valuable... [t]he same applies online." This idea coincides with an idea the group had following the comparative analysis - a countdown timer to apply on the application pages and possibly the program page or even main site. This timer should be at the top of the content. The measurement shown should be relative to the time remaining - "4 months until application window closes" versus "6 days left to apply!" To avoid user confusion, have this timer state "Application window now closed" or "Application window will open in 7 months" following the end of the application period, instead of removing the timer altogether.

### 3. Leverage Social Proof or Authoritative Validation
"Social proof... is a psychological and social phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior in a given situation" ("Social Proof," Wikipedia, 2018). This effect is not a surprise, as testimonials are common on websites selling a product or asking you to join an organization. UMSI could inject social proof into the site by listing the number of graduates. For example, "3,456 Master’s of Science in Information obtained!" or "Over 10,000 alumni working in industry."

Another important element of social proof is authoritative validation, or "third party validation." Since UMSI is currently ranked first for Information System Programs, the US News logo with "Ranked No. 1' or something similar could be subtlety displayed on every page to instill in the prospective student a feeling that UMSI is a top-caliber school.

## Calls to Action
Given the focus on Calls to Action in the UMSI site redesign, we have pulled out the most relevant examples of excellent Calls to Action (CTAs) from [the Hubspot Marketing blog.](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/great-call-to-action-examples)

The [figure 9](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R9.png) CTA personalizes the site by seemingly offering an individually tailored experience.

In the case of [figure 10](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R10.png), the word 'claim' is a strong action word and it imparts urgency.  UMSI could state "Claim Your Spot" or "Claim your degree."

Sometimes, avoiding an action word is good.  In the case of "Learn More," the CTA imparts a perception of work on the user, whereas "What We Do" is more inviting ([figure 11](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R11.png)).

[Figure 12](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%%20R12.png) uses inclusive language ("Let's start" and "together"), which for an organization involving large life changes could be a good approach.

When showing two CTAs, emphasizing the more sought after one that most users look for or the one stakeholders wish to highlight can be done while still organizing the two choices together. [Figure 13](https://github.com/mfldavidson/si631-umsi-site/blob/master/Figure%20R13.png) demonstrates this method, which could be a good way to display "What You'll Learn" with "Apply Now."
